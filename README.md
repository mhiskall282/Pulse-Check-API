#  Pulse Check API
### Dead Man's Switch — Device Heartbeat Monitoring System

> *"Silence is not golden when it comes from a remote solar farm in the middle of nowhere."*

A production-grade backend REST API that monitors remote devices using **stateful countdown timers**. If a device stops sending heartbeats before its timer expires, the system automatically fires a critical alert and simulates an email notification to the responsible engineer.

Built for **CritMon Servers Inc.** — a critical infrastructure monitoring company managing remote solar farms and unmanned weather stations in low-connectivity areas.

## The Problem

CritMon manages hundreds of remote devices — solar farm controllers, weather stations, and sensors — deployed in areas with poor connectivity. These devices are supposed to send **"I'm alive"** signals every hour.

**The gap:** There was no automated way to know when a device went offline due to power failure, theft, or connectivity loss. Engineers only discovered failures when manually checking logs — sometimes hours or days later.

**The solution:** A **Dead Man's Switch API**. Devices register a monitor with a countdown timer. They must keep "defusing" it by sending heartbeats. If a device goes silent — the bomb goes off and an alert fires automatically.

---

##  How It Works

```
Device registers → Timer starts → Device keeps pinging → Timer resets
                                         ↓
                              Device stops pinging
                                         ↓
                              Timer reaches zero → 🚨 ALERT FIRES
```

Think of it like a **bomb timer that devices must keep defusing**:

1. A device registers a monitor with a timeout (e.g. 60 seconds)
2. A background countdown timer starts **immediately**
3. The device must send a heartbeat **before** the timer hits zero
4. Each heartbeat **cancels** the old timer and starts a fresh one
5. If the device goes silent — the system marks it as `DOWN` and fires a critical alert

This pattern is known as a **Dead Man's Switch** — a fail-safe mechanism that triggers when expected activity **stops**.

## Project Structure

The project follows a **modular architecture** based on the **Separation of Concerns** principle. Each file has one clear, single responsibility.

### Why this structure matters

| File | Owns | If you need to change... |
|------|------|--------------------------|
| `database.py` | Storage layer | Swap to PostgreSQL → only touch this file |
| `alerts.py` | Notification layer | Add real SendGrid email → only touch this file |
| `timer.py` | Timer logic | Change countdown behaviour → only touch this file |
| `models.py` | Data contracts | Add new request fields → only touch this file |
| `routes/monitors.py` | HTTP layer | Add or modify endpoints → only touch this file |

This means the codebase is **open for extension, closed for modification** — a core principle of clean software architecture.

## Tech Stack

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **FastAPI** | Web framework — native async support and auto-generated docs |
| **Uvicorn** | ASGI server — runs the async FastAPI application |
| **Pydantic** | Data validation — rejects malformed requests automatically |
| **asyncio** | Concurrent background timers without threading overhead |
| **logging** | Structured, timestamped, levelled logs across all modules |
| **Python 3.12** | Runtime |
| **Render** | Cloud deployment platform |

### Why FastAPI over Django or Node.js?

**vs Django:** Django is a full web framework built for monolithic applications — it includes templating, ORM, and admin panels that this project doesn't need. FastAPI is purpose-built for APIs with native async support that maps directly to our timer architecture.

**vs Node.js:** Python's `asyncio` integrates more naturally with FastAPI's async model. The Pydantic validation layer also provides cleaner, more explicit data contracts than plain JavaScript objects.

**FastAPI's key advantage here:** `asyncio.create_task()` runs background timers concurrently in a single thread — far more efficient than spawning OS threads for each device timer.

2026-03-01 10:35:00 — CRITICAL — [alerts] — {"ALERT": "Device device-123 is DOWN!", "time": "...", "alert_email": "admin@critmon.com"}
2026-03-01 10:35:00 — INFO    — [alerts] — 📧 SIMULATING EMAIL ALERT
2026-03-01 10:35:00 — INFO    — [alerts] —    To:      admin@critmon.com
2026-03-01 10:35:00 — INFO    — [alerts] —    Subject: CRITICAL — Device 'device-123' is offline
2026-03-01 10:35:00 — INFO    — [alerts] —    Body:    Immediate action required.
```

## Developer's Choice Feature

### Heartbeat History Log — `GET /monitors/{id}/history`

**The gap I identified:**

The original spec tracks a device's *current state* but has no memory of past behaviour. When an alert fires, an on-call engineer faces a critical question: *"Was this sudden, or was it coming?"*

Without history, the system is **reactive but not diagnostic**.

**What I built:**

Every heartbeat is appended to a `heartbeat_history` log on the monitor object. The `/history` endpoint exposes this with summary statistics — total heartbeats, first ping, last ping, and the full chronological trail.

**Why this matters in production:**

Real monitoring tools — **AWS CloudWatch**, **Datadog**, **Grafana**, **PagerDuty** — are built on this exact principle. Time-series event logs let engineers:

- Detect devices that are "barely alive" — pinging less and less frequently
- Reconstruct the exact timeline of an incident
- Identify patterns across multiple device failures
- Make data-driven decisions about hardware replacement schedules

**In production:** Stored in **InfluxDB** or **TimescaleDB** — databases purpose-built for time-series data with retention policies and aggregation queries.

---

## Engineering Decisions

### Why asyncio instead of threading?

Each device needs its own running timer. Two options:

- **Threading:** One OS thread per timer. At 1,000 devices = 1,000 threads. Each thread consumes ~8MB of stack memory and adds context-switching overhead.
- **asyncio (chosen):** Single-threaded event loop. `asyncio.sleep()` yields control without blocking. The loop efficiently multiplexes thousands of coroutines. Used by Discord, Nginx, and FastAPI itself.

For a system tracking potentially hundreds of devices, asyncio is the correct choice.

### Why store `active_tasks` separately?

When a heartbeat arrives we need to **cancel** the running timer. Without a reference to the running task, there is no handle to cancel it. `active_tasks` maps device IDs to their `asyncio.Task` objects — giving precise control over every running timer.

### Why in-memory storage?

The spec required a working prototype. A dictionary is the simplest, fastest implementation that correctly demonstrates the pattern. The tradeoff — data loss on restart — is acceptable at this scope. In production: PostgreSQL for monitor records, Redis for timer state (Redis has native TTL support, perfect for countdowns).

### Why `try/except CancelledError` in timer.py?

When a heartbeat cancels a timer, Python raises `asyncio.CancelledError` inside the sleeping coroutine. Without catching it, every successful heartbeat would log an unhandled exception. The `except` block catches the cancellation and returns silently — because cancellation from a heartbeat is **expected, normal behaviour**, not an error.
